		<p> France today is one of the most modern countries in the world 
		and is a leader among European nations. It plays an influential 
		global role as a permanent member of the <span>
		United Nations Security 
		Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU</span>, and other multilateral 
		organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command 
		structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw 
		French forces from NATO. 
		</p>
		
		<p>Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-
		parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities 
		experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations. 
		In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany
		have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, 
		including the introduction of a common currency, <span>
		the euro</span>, 
		in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French 
		overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, 
		Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made 
		part of France proper.
